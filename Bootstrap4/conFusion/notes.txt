things to remember :
bootstrap 4 is mainly 4 3 things
1.responsive

2.mobile first 

3.fluid


there are 5 classes
small
medium
large
xtralarge
and extra small

order-sm-last makes the column go last
order-sm-first makes the column go first


for vertical align just add align-items-center beside the row

for horizontal align use justify -content-center beside the row

offset means leaving some colums
denoted by offset -sm-1 so the class will be shifted to the right by one column

we can nest content
we can make column again a row and then again spit the column into twelve rows
