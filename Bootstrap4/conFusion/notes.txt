things to remember :
bootstrap 4 is mainly 4 3 things
1.responsive

2.mobile first 

3.fluid


there are 5 classes
small
medium
large
xtralarge
and extra small

order-sm-last makes the column go last
order-sm-first makes the column go first


for vertical align just add align-items-center beside the row

for horizontal align use justify -content-center beside the row

offset means leaving some colums
denoted by offset -sm-1 so the class will be shifted to the right by one column

we can nest content
we can make column again a row and then again spit the column into   


min height is very important


so our first component we are going to study is navbar
so we take use of html classes
nav and add the bootstrap classes
1) navbar
2)navbar-dark or navbar-light
3)navbar-expand-sm
toggling the expandable function of when switched to small screens 
4)bg-primary
default is blue with this tag we can change the color of the navbar
5)fixed-top or fixed-bottom
stikcs to the top of the screen


after that the first thing is navbar-brand

then we put a ul with classes
navbar-nav and
mr-auto to make the navbar align to the right

inside the ul we create a li whic will have class nav-item
each itemwill have a <a> which will have href and class nav-link

we can apply the class active to the li item  in whichever page we are so that the user knows he is that page
